# The Wishlist Manifesto

A wishlist, also called a 'Pre-Awesome' list, is a curated collection of feature and tool proposals (wishes), which may also include references to other related wishlists, each containing its own set of wishes. The wishlist follows an RFC-inspired approach in structuring the proposal formats for these wishes.

```
Web → Scattered Wishes → Wishlist → Wish → Feature/Tool → Implementation → Awesome
Web → Scattered Wishes → Wishlist → Wishlist → Wish → Feature/Tool → ... → Awesome
```

### Why add to this wishlist?

Rather than letting great ideas remain scattered across the web or locked in our minds, Wishlist aims to provide a structured, organized space for community collaboration. It helps collect, track and refine proposals, turning innovative ideas into awesome opensource projects.

## Only add refined, meaningful contributions

If you want your wish or list to be included in `wishlist`, try to only include either genuinely innovative and feasible concepts or relevant lists. This is a curated collection of thoughtful proposals, not a dumping ground for technically infeasible ideas or vague lists.

## The Wishlist badge

This badge is for both wishes and wishlists.

[![Wishlist](https://badge.wishlist.sh)](https://wishlist.sh)

```md
[![Wishlist](https://badge.wishlist.sh)](https://wishlist.sh)
```

Add this wishlist badge to the top of your list, right next to the title.\
Alternatively include it in an 'a' tag, for example:

```
<a href="https://wishlist.sh">
    <img src="https://badge.wishlist.sh" alt="Wishlist">
</a>
```

You are allowed to use the badge on lists not included here and also on private lists.

*The badges should not be modified in any way.*

## Propose a wish

**What makes a good wish?**

Research if your proposed wish for a feature or tool could actually be developed with current or near-future technology. Only suggest items that you can thoroughly explain and justify. It's better to have fewer high-quality proposals than many vague wishes.

### Explain why it should exist

Apart from describing your proposed feature or tool, you should also explain:
- What problem it solves
- Why existing solutions (if any) are inadequate
- Who would benefit from it
- What technical challenges might need to be overcome

### Make the scope clear

Have a succinct description of what your proposed feature or tool would do. Make sure your proposal has a clear scope and purpose. Link to existing tools or projects that might serve as inspiration or starting points.

### Pay attention to technical feasibility

Ensure your proposal is technically feasible, even if challenging. Include thoughts about potential implementation approaches, required technologies, and possible limitations.

### Attract interest & funding

Share your wish proposal (gist) with others:
- A wish proposal with positive reactions, such as comments, stars, or forks, will indicate strong interest and support from the community.
- If a wish proposal is good enough it could potentially receive funding, which could increase the chances of success.

## Propose a Wishlist

**What makes a good wishlist?**

While it may not always be possible, a good wishlist should focus on a clear and specific domain. Avoid vague or generic lists, and ensure each item has the potential to add value. The list should consist of high-quality proposals that strictly follow the required guidelines.

### Explain why it should exist

A wishlist should be more than just a collection of random ideas; it should bring order and structure to a sea of concepts. Justify the list's relevance and explain why it matters. For example, when many uncategorized ideas are piling up, it's a good idea to create a new category within an existing list or a new wishlist altogether to maintain structure.

### Make the scope clear

Define the purpose and boundaries of the list. Ensure each item aligns with the overall domain, and avoid overly broad or unfocused entries.

## Include contribution guidelines

People who are contributing to this wishlist should have a clear understanding of how to structure their proposals.

If you don't feel like writing one from scratch, feel free to take our [contributing.md](contributing.md) and modify it to your own needs.

## Stylize your list properly

Create a [table of contents](https://github.com/sindresorhus/stuff/blob/main/toc-generators.md), organize the content into different categories, and use images if suitable. Ensure all entries are consistent (e.g. all entry descriptions end in a `.`).

## Choose an appropriate license

Keep in mind that if you [haven't selected a license](https://choosealicense.com/no-license/), others cannot build upon your ideas and lists. Consider using permissive licenses to encourage development.

[Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/) are perfect for this purpose. **We recommend [`CC0`](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)** to allow maximum freedom for developers to implement these ideas.

## Be open to refinement

If you're proposing an wish or wishlist, be open to suggestions and improvements from others. The best proposals often evolve through community discussion and iteration.
