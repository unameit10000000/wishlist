# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Types of Contributions

There are four main ways to contribute:

1. **Make a wish** - Create a new feature or tool proposal.
2. **Creating your own wishlist** - Start a new curated collection of wishes.
3. **Adding something to a wishlist** - Add your wish or wishlist to an existing wishlist.
4. **Improving this repository** - Add updates, fixes, and improvements.

## Make a wish

To make a wish, check out the [wish instructions](create-wish.md).

## Creating your own wishlist

To create your own list, check out the [list instructions](create-list.md).

## Adding something to a wishlist

If you have an awesome wish or wishlist to contribute to this repo, this is how you do it.

You'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)!

1. Access the wishlist's GitHub page. For example: https://github.com/unameit10000000/wishlist
2. Click on the `readme.md` file.
3. Then click on the edit icon.
4. You can start editing the text of the file in the in-browser editor. Make sure you follow the guidelines above. You can use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).
5. Say why you're proposing the changes, and then click on "Propose file change".
6. Submit the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## Updating your pull request

Sometimes, a maintainer of a wishlist will ask you to edit your pull request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the wish- or wishlist-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write-up on how to change a pull request and the different ways you can do that.

## Improving this repository

This section covers contributions to the core repository itself (documentation, code improvements, etc.) that are NOT related to creating wishlists or making wishes.

If you find something that needs improvement, open an issue to discuss it, then submit a pull request with your changes.

### Best Practices for Contributing

- Start with an issue to document the problem or idea
- Link your pull request to the relevant issue using `#issue_number`
- Keep pull requests focused on a single improvement
- Use comments to communicate and discuss changes
